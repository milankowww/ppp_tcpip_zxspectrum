1. PREAMBLE

 These are the release notes for our implementation of TCP/IP networking.

 Warning:
 This software is NOT free. It's distributed under the terms of the
  GNU General Public License (see the COPYING file for more details).

1.1 WHAT IS IT?

 This software allows you to use your ZX Spectrum computer as a
  workstation of your TCP/IP network. It's not fully RFC-compliant,
  but many of incompatibilities, made for efficiency, can be turned
  off by configuring and re-compiling.
 Low-level part of the implementation includes:

	PPP support	(rfc 1661, rfc 1171, rfc 1331)
	  NCP, LCP	(rfc 1172, rfc 1332)
	IP layer	(rfc 1122)
	ICMP subsystem	(rfc 794, rfc 1122)
	UDP subsystem	(rfc 1122)
	TCP subsystem	(rfc 1122)

There can be minor support of rfc 791(ip), 792, 794(icmp) and 793(tcp).

1.2 HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

 Runs on 3.5MHz 48/128k spectrum. Supports just few serial interfaces,
  but other ones can be easily included by re-writting low-level IO
  routines.

2. CONFIGURING

* Look at 'src/app' directory. choose one application. make link
    to it from 'src/' by
	cd src ; ln -s app/my_app.asm application.asm

* Look at 'src/arch/' directory, find your favourite routines and make
    symlinks to them from 'src/' (at this time only serial routines are
    configurable via arch directory)
* Edit 'src/config.h' and follow instructions and comments.

3. COMPILING

* make clean
* make
    Result will be named tcpip.tap

optionally, you may wish to do
* make install
    which will send output to your sound-card, hopefully connected to the
    tape-in of your spectrum. Before it, you probably would like to
    write  LOAD ""  on your spectrum ;).

4. RUNNING

After loading to your speccy, just break that dumb endless basic loader
  and enter command  RUN.
